Progress and Documentation

Dec 7th:
- I downloaded the template from HTML5UP adn loaded it into my repository
- I began making changes like the names and headers
- I moved the social media icons into the contacts section as I prefered it to be there

Dec 12th:
- I come back to the project and realize it's not loading correctly because I messed around too much with file placement, so the index file couldn't locate the assets. I redownloaded and started from scratch, this time at least knowing what I was doing better
- I changed the colors of the social media icons
- I inserted a picture of myself and a different background in the main.css file
- I looked for a way online to make the "contact me" but work on the website, but it looks like more than I'm able to do right now

Dec 14th:
- I start putting in my songs into the "My Work" section, but I realize I can't get the seeking feature to work in the audio player. I'm following acceptable forms of embedding audio so I don't get what's going on
- so it turns out, it doesn't work when I'm running it in local server, but once the website loads, it's all good
