Progress and Documentation
Dec 7th:
- I downloaded the template from HTML5UP adn loaded it into my repository
- I began making changes like the names and headers
- I moved the social media icons into the contacts section as I prefered it to be there
Dec 12th:
- I come back to the project and realize it's not loading correctly because I messed around too much with file placement, so the index file couldn't locate the assets. I redownloaded and started from scratch, this time at least knowing what I was doing better
- I changed the colors of the social media icons
- I inserted a picture of myself and a different background in the main.css file
